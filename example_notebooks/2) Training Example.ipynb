    "#### 2) Training Decoders in Practice\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have discussed the conceptual foundations, strategies and techniques involved, we will provide detailed examples of how train decoders via the procedures discussed. In particular, in this notebook we will walk through a very simple script for training a decoder with a given set of hyper-parameters, providing the foundation for a later discussion concerning how to obtain optimal decoders for a range of error rates through an iterative training procedure involving a hyper-parameter optimization for each error rate (see the companion notebook \"Large Scale Iterative Training\"). \n",

    "We then proceed by providing all required hyperparameters and physical configuration settings. In order to allow for easier grid searching and incremented training later on we choose to split all hyperparameters into two categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - fixed configs: These remain constant during the course of a grid search or incremented training procedure.\n",
    "   - variable configs: We will later set up training grids over these hyperparameters.\n",
    "    \n",
    "In particular, the fixed parameters one must provide are:\n",
    "\n",
    "   1. **d**: The lattice width (equal to the lattice height)\n",
    "   - **use_Y**: If true then the agent can perform Y Pauli flips directly, if False then the agent can only perform X and Z Pauli flips.\n",
    "   - **train_freq**: The number of agent-environment interaction steps which occur between each updating of the agent's weights.\n",
    "   - **batch_size**: The size of batches used for calculating loss functions for gradient descent updates of agent weights.\n",
    "   - **print_freq**: Every print_freq episodes the statistics of the training procedure will be logged.\n",
    "   - **rolling_average_length**: The number of most recent episodes over which any relevant rolling average will be calculated.\n",
    "   - **stopping_patience**: The number of episodes after which no improvement will result in the early stopping of the training procedure.\n",
    "   - **error_model**: A string in [\"X\", \"DP\"], specifiying the noise model of the environment as X flips only or depolarizing noise.\n",
    "   - **c_layers**: A list of lists specifying the structure of the convolutional layers of the agent deepQ network. Each inner list describes a layer and has the form [num_filters, filter_width, stride].\n",
    "   - **ff_layers**: A list of lists specifying the structure of the feed-forward neural network sitting on top of the convolutional neural network. Each inner list has the form [num_neurons, output_dropout_rate].\n",
    "   - **max_timesteps**: The maximum number of training timesteps allowed.\n",
    "   - **volume_depth**: The number of syndrome measurements taken each time a new syndrome extraction is performed - i.e. the depth of the syndrome volume passed to the agent.\n",
    "   - **testing_length**: The number of episodes uses to evaluate the trained agents performance. \n",
    "   - **buffer_size**: The maximum number of experience tuples held in the memory from which the update batches for agent updating are drawn.\n",
    "   - **dueling**: A boolean indicating whether or not a [dueling architecture](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06581) should be used.\n",
    "   - **masked_greedy**: A boolean which indicates whether the agent will only be allowed to choose legal actions (actions next to an anyon or previously flipped qubit) when acting greedily (i.e. when choosing actions via the argmax of the Q-values)\n",
    "   - **static_decoder**: For training within the fault tolerant setting (multi-cycle decoding) this should always be set to True.\n",
    "   \n",
    "In addition, the parameters which we will later incrementally vary or grid search around are:\n",
    "\n",
    "   1. **p_phys**: The physical error probability\n",
    "   2. **p_meas**: The measurement error probability\n",
    "   3. **success_threshold**: The qubit lifetime rolling average at which training has been deemed succesfull and will be stopped.\n",
    "   4. **learning_starts**: The number of initial steps taken to contribute experience tuples to memory before any weight updates are made.\n",
    "   5. **learning_rate**: The learning rate for gradient descent optimization (via the Adam optimizer)\n",
    "   6. **exploration_fraction**: The number of time steps over which epsilon, the parameter controlling the probability of a random explorative action, is annealed.\n",
    "   7. **max_eps**: The initial maximum value of epsilon.\n",
    "   8. **target_network_update_freq**: In order to achieve stable training, a target network is cloned off from the active deepQ agent every target_network_update_freq interval of steps. This target network is then used to generate the target Q-function over the following interval.\n",
    "   9. **gamma**: The discount rate used for calculating the expected discounted cumulative return (the Q-values).\n",
    "   10. **final_eps**: The final value at which annealing of epsilon will be stopped.\n",
    "   \n",
    "Furthermore, in addition to all the above parameters one must provide a directory into which results and training progress as logged, as well as the path to a pre-trained referee decoder. Here e provide two pre-trained feed forward classification based referee decoders, one for X noise and one for DP noise. However, in principle any perfect-measurement decoding algorithm (such as MWPM) could be used here."
