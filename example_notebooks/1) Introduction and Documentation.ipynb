    "#### 1) Setting\n",
    "\n",
    "Topological quantum error correcting codes, and in particular the surface code, currently provide the most promising path to scalable fault tolerant quantum computation. While a variety of decoders exist for such codes, recently decoders obtained via machine learning techniques have attracted attention due to both their potential flexibility, with respect to codes and noise models, and their potentially fast run times. Here, we demonstrate how reinforcement learning techniques, and in particular deepQ learning, can be utilized to solve this problem and obtain such decoders.\n",

    "To be more specific, lets consider the above illustration:\n",
    "\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "  <li>In the top left, we start with a state in the code space - i.e. a state for which no stabilizers are violated. Our goal is to maintain the logical qubit in this state. </li>\n",
    "  <li>Now, while storing the logical qubit (between gates for instance) the physical qubits are subject to noise. We consider depolarizing noise here for simplicity, for which in each unit of time each physical qubit is subject to either a Pauli X, Y or Z flip with a given probability (the physical error rate). In the above illustration, we imagine an X flip occurring on the physical qubit in the third row and second column.  </li>\n",
    "  <li>In order to maintain the code in the state it was given to us, we therefore need to perform a correction by applying an X gate to the qubit which was randomly flipped. To do this, we need perform a syndrome extraction, from which our decoding algorithm can attempt to diagnose the error configuration which gave rise to the received syndrome. However, as illustrated in the diagram, the syndrome extraction process is also noisy, and for each stabilizer there is a probability (the measurement error rate) that the measured stabilizer value is incorrect - i.e. that we see a violated stabilizer where there is not one, or no violated stabilizer where there actually is one.</li>\n",
    "   <li> To deal with this situation, instead of providing a single syndrome to the decoder, we perform multiple (faulty) syndrome measurements, between which physical errors may also occur. We then provide as input to our decoder not a single syndrome, but a stacked volume of successive syndrome slices.\n",
    "   <li> From this syndrome volume the decoding algorithm needs to suggest corrections which when applied to the code lattice move the logical qubit back into the original state (in practice, these corrections are not actually implemented, but rather tracked through the computation, and applied in a single step at the end).\n",
    "   <li> In the ideal case the decoder will be able to correctly diagnose a sufficient proportion of syndrome volumes, such that the probability of an error occurring on the logical qubit is lower than the physical error rate on a physical qubit.\n",

    "### 1c) DeepQ Learning as a Tool for Obtaining Decoders\n",

    "Given the problem as specified above, we utilize <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14236\">DeepQ</a> <a href=\"http://incompleteideas.net/book/bookdraft2017nov5.pdf\">reinforcement learning</a>, a technique which has been sucessfully used to obtain agents capable of super-human performance in domains such as  <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14236\">Atari</a>, to obtain decoders which are capable of dealing with faulty measurements up to a threshold physical and measurement error rate. We will not go too deeply into the details and theory of Q-learning here, as an excellent introduction can be found in the fantastic textbook of <a href=\"http://incompleteideas.net/book/bookdraft2017nov5.pdf\">Sutton and Barto</a>, which is strongly recommended.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, to give a brief overview, the rough idea is that we will utilize a deep neural network (a convolutional neural network in our case) to parameterize the $Q$-function of a decoding agent, which interacts with the code lattice (the environment). This $Q$-function is a function which maps from states of the environment - syndrome volumes plus histories of previously applied corrections - to a $Q$-value for each available correction, where the $Q$-value of a given action, with respect to a particular environment state, encodes the expected long term benefit (not the exact technical definition!) to the agent of applying that correction when in that state. Given the $Q$-values corresponding to a given environment state, the optimal correction strategy then corresponds to applying the correction with the largest $Q$-value. Within this framework, the goal is then to obtain the optimal $Q$-function, which is done by letting the agent interact with the environment, during which the agents experiences are used to iteratively update the $Q$-function.\n",

    "  <li> As illustrated and described in Section 1b. (the \"Decoding Problem\"), an episode starts with the extraction of a (faulty) syndrome volume from the code (a, b). If the syndrome volume is trivial, i.e. there is not a single anyon in the entire volume, then another syndrome volume is extracted.</li>\n",
    "  <li> As a new syndrome volume has just been extracted, the action history is reset to all zeros (c).</li>\n",
